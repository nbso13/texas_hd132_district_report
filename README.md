### Background
I performed and presented this analysis to the Campbell campaign in 2022 for Texas House District 132. They used these recommendations to canvas in the highlighted precincts in the attached presentation. Note that I've stripped the data here to only include relevant columns, and taken out identifying information, and scrambled IDs to protect privacy. You can run this yourself (run the main script in the scripts folder, which will save the output in the 'results' folder). Check out the included PDF for an overview of how these results were used. You may need to pip install relevant python packages.
